# :wave: About Me

I am a **Computer Science Honors** and **Statistics Honors** student at **Purdue University** minoring in Mathematics. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and generative modeling.

I'm an **SDE intern** at **Amazon** for Summer 2025. I also work on motion planning at the **Cognitive Robot Autonomy & Learning (CoRAL)** Lab under assistant professor **Ahmed H. Qureshi**.

- **Multi-agent Relational Keypoints for Zero-Shot Robotics Manipulation** *(2025)*
- **Neural Signal Temporal Logic Vision-Language Planner** *(2024)*
- **Action Segmentation for Manual Manufacturing Process Analysis** *(2024)*
